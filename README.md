Christian Auman


### Introduction:
This lab was to explain the process of installing Visual Studio, and creating a basic Hello World program in c++. This lab should provide a basic hello world program where the program prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This program should use \<iostream\> for the input and output. The other purpose of this lab was to learn how to write a lab report.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
### Software Design Methodology: 
The procedure of this design was to use iostream to output strings to the console. (using std::cout << "(string here)"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
### Results: 
**Initial Hello World program**

### Conclusion and Discussion:
The takeaway of this lab was to learn how the basic labs work, how to install and create a Visual Studio project, and the basic functionalities of input and output in c++ using the iostream library.
